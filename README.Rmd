# tbrdec2020

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tbrdec2020 is to demonstrate a full round of my cleat mark device method. This means everything from making the mix from two raw components, determining the optimum compaction moisture, preparing a set of samples, testing them with the device, and deriving data from the 3D scans. 

In addition, I am trying out the **rrtools** package for tracking the work in a reproducible way. I think this package will prove useful, especially if deployed via GitHub Pages. That way I can easily point Andy (or myself) to intermediate findings via **xaringan** HTML slides.
