The goal of tbrdec2020 is to demonstrate a full round of my cleat mark
device method. This means everything from making the mix from two raw
components, determining the optimum compaction moisture, preparing a set
of samples, testing them with the device, and deriving data from the 3D
scans.

In addition, I am trying out the rrtools package for tracking the work
in a reproducible way. I think this package will prove useful,
especially if deployed via GitHub Pages. That way I can easily point
Andy (or myself) to intermediate findings via xaringan HTML slides.

Note that the data directory is not version controlled. This is due to
the very large sizes of .ply files; however, all raw data are kept
inside this same project and directory structure and stored with PSUâ€™s
unlimited OneDrive storage. The files themselves never change; if
altered they are saved as totally new versions, and therefore it is not
important to version-control the mesh files.
